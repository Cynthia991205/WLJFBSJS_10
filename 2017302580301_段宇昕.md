# Homework 10
## P14
a. *Router 3c* learns prefix x from protocol **eBGP**.(Gateway Router. It receives the prefix message from its neighbor AS4.)  

b. *Router 3a* learns prefix x from protocol **iBGP**.(Internal Router. It receives the prefix message from gateway router 3c.)  

c. *Router 1c* learns prefix x from protocol **eBGP**.(Gateway Router. It receives the prefix message from its neighbor AS3.)  

d. *Router 1d* learns prefix x from protocol **iBGP**.(Internal Router. It receives the prefix message from gateway router 1c.)  

## P15 (based on P14)
a. I corresponds to **I1**, because I1 is the start interface of the least-cost link path from 1d to 1c.  

b. I corresponds to **I2**.   
Although both BGP route information:  
   1. 3a; AS3 AS4; x   
   2. 2a; AS2 AS4; x  

have the same length of AS-PATH, I2 is the start interface of the least-cost link path to NEXT-HOP(In this case, the NEXT-HOP refers to 2a).  

c. I corresponds to **I1**. The two BGP route information:   
   1. 3a; AS3 AS4; x   
   2. 2a; AS2 AS5 AS4; x  
 
The first one has smaller AS-PATH, and I1 is the start of the least-cost link path from 1d to 1c(then 3a).  

## P16
If C conceals the peering point on the west coast in the route to D, only advertising the peering point on the east coast to B, then B will forced to take over the flow throughout the country.
