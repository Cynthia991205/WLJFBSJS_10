## P12
Detect the AS-PATH attribute of each route in BGP. 
If the AS-PATH attribute of a route received by a node contains its own as, the route will generate a ring.

## P14
a. eBGP  

b. iBGP  

c. eBGP  

d. iBGP   

## P15
a. I1. Because I1 is the interface corresponding to the minimum cost path from 1D to gateway router 1C.  

b. I2. Because I1 and I2 have the same AS-PATH length, I2 corresponds to the route closest to the next-hop router.  

c. I1. At this time, the path corresponding to I1 has the shortest AS-PATH length of 2, while the AS-PATH length corresponding to I2 is 3. 

## P16
One way to do this is C only publish the route to D from the peer point of C in east coast.  

## P19
A announces AW and AV routes to B, AV routes to C, so AS routes received by C include BAW, BAV and AV.
