**P14**


a) Router 3c learns about prefix x from eBGP. 

b) Router 3a learns about prefix x from iBGP. 

c) Router 1c learns about prefix x from eBGP. 

d) Router 1d learns about prefix x from iBGP.

**P15**

a) I1. Because this interface begins the least cost path from 1d to the gateway router 1c. 
 
b) I2. Because both routes have equal AS-PATH length but the path which I2 begins has the closest NEXT-HOP router. 
 
c) I1. Because I1 begins the path with the shortest AS-PATH.
