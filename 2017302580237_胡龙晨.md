(a) D<sub>x</sub>(w) = 2 , D<sub>x</sub>(y) = 4 , D<sub>x</sub>(u)=7  

(b) So let's think about what happens when c(x,y) changes , If c(x,y) becomes larger or smaller (as long as c(x,y) >=1), then the least expensive path from x to u still costs at least 7. Therefore, a change in c(x,y)(if c(x,y)>=1) will not cause x to notify its neighbors of any change.    
If c(x,y) < a+1, then the least cost path now passes through y and has cost a+6.  
Now let's think about whether c(x,w) changes. If c(x,w) = a <= 1, then the minimum cost path to u continues through w, and its cost changes to 5 + a; X will notify its neighbors of this new cost. If c of x,w is equal to a > 6, then the least expensive path now goes through y, and the cost is 11; Again, x will notify its neighbors of this new cost.  

(c) Any change in link cost c(x,y)(and as long as c(x,y) >=1) will not cause x to notify its neighbors of a new minimum cost path to u.  

## T9
No, this is because reducing the link cost does not result in a loop (caused by the next-hop relationship between the two nodes of the link). Connecting two nodes with one link reduces the link weight from infinite to finite.

## T10
In each step, each update of the node distance vector is based on the bellman-ford equation, that is, only the values in the distance vector are reduced. No increase in value. If there is no update, no message is sent. So D of x is not increasing. Since these costs are finite, the distance vector will eventually stabilize in a finite number of steps.

## T12
Since the full AS path information from AS to destination is available in the BGP, cyclic detection is simple -- if the BGP peer receives a route containing its own AS number in the AS path, the use of this route will result in a loop.

## T14
(a) eBGP  
(b) iBGP  
(c) eBGP  
(d) iBGP
