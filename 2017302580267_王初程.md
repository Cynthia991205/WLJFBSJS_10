### P14

#### question a

Router 3c learns about prefix x from eBGP.

#### question b

Router 3a learns about prefix x from iBGP.

#### question c

Router 1c learns about prefix x from eBGP.

#### question d

Router 1d learns about prefix x from iBGP.

### P15

#### question a

I1. I1 is the starting point of the path with the lowest cost from 1d to the gateway router 1c.

#### question b

I2. Both routers have the same AS-PATH, but I2 starts with the path of the closest NEXT-HOP router.

#### question c

I1. The path corresponding to I1 has the shortest AS-PATH length 2 at this time, and the AS-PATH length corresponding to I2 is 3.
