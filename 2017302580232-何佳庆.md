### P14.

a. Since $3c$ learns the prefix x from route : *AS4 x*, so that the protocol is **eBGP**.

b. $3a$ learns the prefix x from inner route, so that the protocol is **iBGP**.

c. $1c$ learns the prefix x from outter route, so that the protocol is **eBGP**.

d. Since no physical paths between AS2 and AS4, so that $1d$ uses the protocol **iBGP**.

### P15

a. The answer is $I_1$, since the route from $1d$ to $1c$ has lower cost.

b. The answer is $I_2$, since the route starts with $I_2$ has nearer NEXT_HOP.

c. The answer is $I_1$, since the route *AS2 AS5 AS4* has longer distance compared with another route that starts with $I_1$.
