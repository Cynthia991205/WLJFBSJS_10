d. iBGP
 
### P15
a. l1:Because I1 is the interface corresponding to the minimum cost path from 1D to gateway router 1C<br>
b. l2:Because I1 and I2 have the same AS-PATH length, I2 corresponds to the route closest to the next-hop router<br>
c. l1:At this time, the path corresponding to I1 has the shortest AS-PATH length of 2, while the AS-PATH length corresponding to I2 is 3.
