P14:  
a) eBGP  
b) iBGP  
c) eBGP  
d) iBGP  

P16:  
One way to do this is C only publish the route to D from the peer point of C in east coast.  

P19:  
As for B, A should advise him two routesï¼šAS-paths A-W and A-V. As for C, A should advise him only one route:A-V. Then C receives AS paths: B-A-W, B-A-V and A-V.
