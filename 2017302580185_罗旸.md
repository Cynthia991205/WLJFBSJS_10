**Q11**

a. 

| Router   | Description                |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| Router z | Informs w, $D_z(x)=\infty$ |
|          | Informs y, $D_z(x)=6$      |
| Router w | Informs y, $D_w(x)=\infty$ |
|          | Informs z, $D_w(x)=5$      |
| Router y | Informs w, $D_y(x)=4$      |
|          | Informs z, $D_y(x)=4$      |

b. Yes. Assume that at time $t_0$, link cost change happens. At time $t_1$, y updates its distance vector and informs neighbors w and z.

| time | $t_0$                      | $t_1$                      | $t_2$                      | $t_3$                      | $t_4$                      |
| ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Z    | Informs w, $Dz(x)=\infty$  |                            | No change                  | Informs w, $D_z(x)=\infty$ |                            |
|      | Informs y, $D_z(x)=6$      |                            |                            | Informs y, $D_z(x)=11$     |                            |
| W    | Informs y, $D_w(x)=\infty$ |                            | Informs y, $D_w(x)=\infty$ |                            | No change                  |
|      | Informs z, $D_w(x)=5$      |                            | Informs z,$D_w(x)=10$      |                            |                            |
| Y    | Informs w, $D_y(x)=4$      | Informs w, $D_y(x)=9$      |                            | No change                  | Informs w, $D_y(x)=14$     |
|      | Informs z, $D_y(x)=4$      | Informs z, $D_y(x)=\infty$ |                            |                            | Informs z, $D_y(x)=\infty$ |

We can find that there is a loop in their computation of the costs to router x. Until $t_{31}$ there is no updating and the routing is stabilized.

| time | $t_{27}$               | $t_{28}$                    | $t_{29}$                    | $t_{30}$                    | $t_{31}$        |
| ---- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| Z    | Informs w, $D_z(x)=50$ |                             |                             | No change                   | via w, $\infty$ |
|      | Informs y, $D_z(x)=50$ |                             |                             |                             | via y, 55       |
|      |                        |                             |                             |                             | via z, 50       |
| W    |                        | Informs y, $D_w(x)=\infty$  | Informs y, $D_w(x)=51$      |                             | via w, $\infty$ |
|      |                        | Informs z, $D_w(x)=50$      | Informs z, $D_w(x)= \infty$ |                             | via y, $\infty$ |
|      |                        |                             |                             |                             | via z, 51       |
| Y    |                        | Informs w, $D_y(x)=53$      | No change                   | Informs w, $D_y(x)= \infty$ | via w, 52       |
|      |                        | Informs z, $D_y(x)= \infty$ |                             | Informs z, $D_y(x)= 52$     | via y, 60       |
|      |                        |                             |                             |                             | via z, 53       |

c. Becasue whatever the cost between y and z is, y will always firstly choose the router path including y itself, we cut the link between y and z.

**Q12**

Since full AS path information is available from an AS to a destination in BGP, we can detect them in the process of selecting the AS path â€“ if a BGP peer receives a route that contains its own AS number in the AS path, then using that route would result in a loop.

**Q15**

a. $I_1$ . Easy to know, interface $I_1$ begins the least cost path from 1d towards the gateway router 1c.

b. $I_2$. Although two interfaces begin the same AS-PATH length path, $I_2$ begins the path that has the closest NEXT-HOP router.

c. $I_1$. Beacuse $I_1$ begins the path that has the shortest AS-PATH.

**Q19**

A should notice two routes to B: AS-PATHs A-W and A-V. 

A should notice only one route to C: AS-PATH: A-V.

C receives AS-PATHs: B-A-W, B-A-V, A-V.

**Q22**

As we all know, the time when network management is most needed is in times of stress, when the network may be severely congested and packets are being lost. With SNMP running over TCP, TCP's congestion control would cause SNMP to back-off and stop sending messages at precisely the time when the network manager needs to send SNMP messages.
